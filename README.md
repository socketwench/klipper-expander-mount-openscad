# Klipper Expander mount -- OpenSCAD version

This is an OpenSCAD reimplemention of [StvnLutz's Klipper Expander Mount for 2020 Extrusions](https://www.printables.com/model/228244-klipper-expander-mount-for-aluminum-extrusions).

While the original design is simple, only the STL is provided. I reimplemented the mount in OpenSCAD to facilitate remixing.
